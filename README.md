**ONLY READ IF YOU'RE COMING FROM PONYTOWN.**

Hi, I'm Felix, but you can also call me Adam or Axel. Any works, I don't mind. I'm 15, transmasc genderfluid, and bisexual [male lean]. I'm taken as well, so I'd prefer if you didn't flirt with me. I use He/It/That Thing pronouns, and you can find my pronouny at https://pronouny.xyz/u/adammurray.

I am autistic, psychotic and a system host. I have many illnesses and disabilities but I prefer not to share them. I am an IRL of Adam Murray, Felix Kranken, Yuri (DDLC), Susie (Deltarune), Chara Dreemurr, Ruvyzvat, Axel Chains and many more. I don't like doubles and will probably hide you if you are one. The only exceptions are to this are fictives and is if you're already a friend of mine. (You guys know who you are.) If it matters, I heavily kin Thatcher Davis. Sometimes I often refer to him as my dad, I know it's confusing but it depends on my mood really.

**BOUNDARIES / INFO ABOUT SPOT**
You will mostly always see me in the Mandela Catalogue spot. I am usually sitting under a tree or by the torch. Please don't boop me, kiss me, or cuddle me if I don't have you friended. I don't have a TT/TD, it just makes me uncomfortable. Do not crowd me. I'm super uncomfortable with that and it overwhelms me. I'm okay with crowns, in fact I love recieving them.

**DNI**
Proship/Comship/Freaks that think fiction doesn't affect reality. Dave Lee x Thatcher Davis, Mark Heathcliff x Cesar Torres shippers. You guys are weird. Basic DNI criteria. (LGBTphobe, Bigoted, y'know.) People who support YBC, YBF, Killing Stalking, or any of those murder/yaoi glorifying medias. People who disrespect TT/TD on purpose. I don't care if you think it's not real, you don't need to be a dick about it.

***Thank you for reading! It means a lot to me.***
